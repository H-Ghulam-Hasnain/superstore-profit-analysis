## üéØ 5. Recommendations for Profit Optimization

Based on these findings, the following actions are recommended to boost profitability:

### **Recommendation 1: Drastically Revise Discount Policy**
* **Action:** Immediately review and restrict any discounts exceeding $20\%$.
* **Rationale:** Discounts greater than $20\%$ are the **direct cause** of negative profit in the highest-selling categories (Furniture and Technology).

### **Recommendation 2: Operational Focus on Central Region**
* **Action:** Launch a detailed investigation into the **Central Region's** logistics, operational costs, and local pricing strategies, focusing on the underperforming **Consumer Segment**.
* **Rationale:** Addressing the low profitability in the Central Region offers the biggest opportunity for immediate profit gains.

### **Recommendation 3: Eliminate or Reprice Loss-Making Products**
* **Action:** Reduce inventory or significantly increase the selling price of **Tables** and **Bookcases** to make them profitable.
* **Rationale:** These two sub-categories are a disproportionate drain on total company profit.
